# Todo List Web App

A simple, responsive Todo List web application built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This app allows users to **add, delete, and track tasks** with timestamps and dates. All tasks are stored in **localStorage**, so your list persists even after refreshing the page.

* Delete tasks individually.
* Shows **“No tasks yet”** message when the list is empty.
